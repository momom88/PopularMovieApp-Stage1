# PopularMovieApp-Stage1

User Experience
In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.


Your app will:

* Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
* A llow your user to change sort order via a setting:
* The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date

To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org.
If you don’t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

API KEY must add to java class NetworkUtils to String movieApiKey . package com.example.android.popularmovieapp.utilities;
